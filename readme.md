# Spring Batch CSV to Database Project.

This project demonstrates the use of Spring Batch to process and transfer 1000 records from a CSV file to a database.

The application includes the Batch configuration class, the DAO/Repository class and a custom processor to modify the records by changing the id given by the CSV and defining a "savedAt" attribute before persisting the data in the database.
